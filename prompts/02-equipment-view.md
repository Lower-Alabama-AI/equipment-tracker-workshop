  - Checked Out (yellow badge) 
  - Maintenance (red badge)

  - "View Details" if checked out

Add a search bar at the top to filter equipment by name or category.

Add filter buttons for:

The cards should be in a responsive grid (4 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile).

Include hover effects on the cards.
